# About Me
Hi there, my name is Ruiquan Huang. I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://psu.edu" target="_blank">[The Pennsylvania State University]</a>, and am fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://www.ee.psu.edu/yang/">Jing Yang</a>. My research focuses on *reinforcement learning*, *transformer theory*, *safety and privacy issues* in learning problems.
