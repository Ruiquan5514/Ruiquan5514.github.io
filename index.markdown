<img align="right" src="profile_pic_01.jpg" width="150" style="margin-left: 20px;">
Hi there, my name is Ruiquan Huang (pronounced 'Ray-chwen Hwang', you are also welcome to call me Ray). I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://psu.edu" target="_blank">The Pennsylvania State University</a>, and am fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://www.ee.psu.edu/yang/" target="_blank">Jing Yang</a>. Prior to that, I received my B.S. from the <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a>, and M.S. degrees from <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank"> Columbia University</a> .

<br>
<br>

My research interests lie in broad areas, ranging from *reinforcement learning (RL)* and *bandits* to *statistical learning theory* and *deep learning*. The ultimate goal is to advance machine learning (ML) and develop provable yet practically **efficient and trustworthy** machine learning algorithms. My current research topics can be largely grouped into five aspects of efficiency and trustworthiness in ML: (1) **statistical efficiency**, (2) **computational efficiency**, (3) **safety**, (4) **privacy**, and (5) **robustness**.
