Hi there, my name is Ruiquan Huang. I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://psu.edu" target="_blank">The Pennsylvania State University</a>, and am fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://www.ee.psu.edu/yang/" target="_blank">Jing Yang</a>. Prior to that, I received my B.S. from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and M.S. degrees from Columbia University.

My research focuses on *reinforcement learning*, *transformer theory*, *safety and privacy issues* in learning problems.
